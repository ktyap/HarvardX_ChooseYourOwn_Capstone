## HarvardX PH125.9x - Data Science: Capstone (Choose Your Own Project)

This capstone project is part of the requirement for the [PH125.9x: Data Science: Capstone](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-capstone). In this project, a data set of biomechanical features of orthopedic patients is used to create a classification model to predict patients as belonging to three categories:  _Normal_ (100 patients), _Disk Hernia_ (60 patients) or _Spondylolisthesis_ (150 patients). The latter two classes are considered _abnormal_ classes.

Each patient(data point) in the data set has a total of seven features of _numeric_ type (*pelvic incidence*, *pelvic tilt*, *lumbar lordosis angle*, *sacral slope*, *pelvic radius* and *grade of spondylolisthesis*).

A total of three machine learning models (classification tree, random forest and support vector machine) are trained and tested with a data set of [biomechanical features of orthopedic patients](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/biomechanical-features-of-orthopedic-patients). These are classification models which can be used to classify patients based on six features, with each patient belonging to one of the three categories.
